A pathfinding tool that helps visualize algorithms as they look for the paths to reach the destination. I was inspired to create this tool after learning about Dijkstra's algorithm.

(important) Only Dijkstra's algorithm is available at the moment, but more algorithms will be added in the future!

The visualization tool can be found here: https://jixsu.github.io/Pathfind/

Quick Guide:

- Select algorithm along top menu (only Dijkstra's available at the moment)
- Click Visualize to see it in action!
- Addons can be selected on top menu
- Addons can be added by left clicking (and dragging) on the board
- Right click to remove addon
- Board must be cleared or reset before making any changes
