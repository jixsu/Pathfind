A pathfinding tool that helps visualize algorithms as they look for the paths to reach the destination. I was inspired to create this tool after learning about Dijkstra's algorithm.

(important) Only Dijkstra's algorithm is available at the moment, but more algorithms will be added in the future!

The visualization tool can be found here: https://jixsu.github.io/Pathfind/
